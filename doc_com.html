                In the 21st-century, people have come up with many ways of entertaining to fill up the
                fleeting free moments in our over-scheduled lives. There are many things that we love to do but above
                all, we love spending money. Some may say that our obsession with shopping reflects self-indulgence
                and luxury, really we are partaking in the evolution of capitalism. E-commerce is the new wave of
                capitalism, that is buying things online, transforming the technology of the World Wide Web into a
                Marketplace.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jeff Bezos and Pierre Omidyar, the founders of Amazon and eBay, were some of the people that viewed the
                internet as a marketplace back in the 90s. Omidyar believed that he could use the power of the
                technology of the internet to bring people together into a marketplace using the market mechanism An
                opening that out to regular people, creating a level playing field where everyone could participate
                in the market. Omidyar believed that an auction-style site would be the fairest. Thanks to the
                explosiveness of the internet, eBay and Amazon were able to flourish.
            </p>
            <p>
                This explosion fueled a mania amongst Americans and created a bubble. It was a modern-day Gold Rush.
                People poured money into the stock market and the stocks of these e-commerce companies. Any company
                with a dot com attached to its name, people wanted to invest in, after seeing the success of eBay and
                Amazon. In the same breath, there was a democratization of the stock market, removing the power from
                Wall Street brokers and giving access to the public.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, every bubble must burst, and the first wave of e-commerce was a fragile one. Many e-commerce
                businesses that had been booming failed to draw in the necessary revenue during the holiday season.
                On April 14, 2000, the stock market crashed in the single greatest collapse in the history of the
                stock market.
