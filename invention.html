            <p>
                The internet is a hallmark of the 21st Century. Born in the late 50’s through government funding, the
                internet has grown to be inextricable from our daily lives. The internet is the fastest growing
                invention in human history touching many lives. it provides instant access to things happening
                anywhere. It is also responsible for a lot of financial growth and for fueling the US economy. it's a
                key culture key component of our culture and civilization and remains under the control of no one. The
                idea of the internet was brought about by a psychologist named J.C.R. Licklider. He envisioned what
                computers would allow better communication, and that computers could all be connected at the same time
                so that they could be better at sharing information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Computer communication was something unimaginable in the early 50’s, likened to science fiction. At
                first, computers were unbelievably large, expensive, never made to communicate with one another.
                Computers used to take up the space of a room. Few and far between, you might see one in your city
                or be lucky to have one on your college campus.
            </p>
            <p>
                The internet was spurred on due to the Soviet superiority during the Cold War. in October 1957, the
                Soviet Union launched Sputnik, so in order to catch up in that space race, President Eisenhower
                created the Bureau of the defense department called ARPA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency.
                The Space Program also included computer science. However, when space exploration got its own dedicated
                agency, NASA, computer research was no longer funded by the government.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the space program was given a boost, computer communication was still coming together. Leonard
                Kleinrock, an MIT Grad student, began applying queue theory to data transmission, noting that queue
                theory was a great tool for evaluating computer and communication systems. He also implemented two
                methods of increasing the speed of the internet: demand access and distributed control. demand access
                just means that the computer does not hold on to all of the possible files, just the ones that the user
                wants to access when the user wants to access them from the data Network. distributed control means
                that within the network no one switch device Authority controls the entire network but rather every
                switch shares that control. This helps decide the routing procedure of the data.

            </p>
            <p>
                This breaks away from telephone system of circuit switching, where telephones are connected by a
                circuit that's created between the two machines and a single connection is dedicated to the single
                conversation until one of the machines hangs up. The only issue with this system is that once the
                connection is broken the connection is lost. This became a national security matter in the early 60’s
                during the Cold War when there was fear of a Soviet nuclear attack, because not only would cities be
                leveled, communications would be lost completely, because telephone lines run above ground so the
                military would be unable to launch a counterattack.
            </p>
            <p>
                To counteract this flaw an expert, Paul Baran, was hired to see if that could be overcome. He created
                a fishnet type system with hot potato routing so traffic can find its way through the network with the
                data chopped up into smaller pieces so even if part of the network was destroyed the message would get
                to where it needed to go. By 1962 there was enough research and theory to show that a computer network
                could be built, but one was not built until 1969.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1966 Bob Taylor of ARPA moved to build a network, so that all the time share computers, that were
                previously unable to communicate, could talk to one another. This was so that instead of logging into
                multiple terminals to access multiple computers and multiple files on those computers, Taylor could log
                in to one terminal and access the entire network.
            </p>
            <p>
                Arpanet was born in UCLA in September of 1969, and at that stage, it was still a primitive computer
                network. In 1971 with 18 mainframe computers in the network, Arpanet started covering a large distance.
                The email was born as Tomlinson created method of sending files across a network, and simultaneously
                assigned the @ symbol to this method of communication.
            </p>
            <p>
                The internet was built with an open architecture, meaning that anyone could contribute to it and help
                it grow. This is why the internet was able to evolve to rapidly. Arpanet evolved into the internet,
                connecting many machines over LANs (local area networks) and WANs (wide area networks). Those networks
                were made to communicate with one another using TCP/IP protocols in 1973. Arpanet was developed to be a
                tool for defense research for the government, restricted to government, and some select universities.
                In 1992, Congress passed a law that moved the internet from the control of the government to the public.
