                The thing people desire the most nowadays is a connection with other people, through communication.
                YouTube and Facebook have made these connections possible. Steve Chen, Jawed Karim, and Chad Hurley
                founded YouTube, the online video sharing service. Youtube is part of the new wave of web services,
                allowing the public to create content in industries that were previously closed off, like the TV
                industry. Chen, Karim, and Hurley have put the power of creation - and monetization in the hands of
                everyone. Youtube was bought by Google in 2006, and that deal helped the service survive. YouTube had
                always been about user-generated content,  allowing users to express creativity and indulge in vanity.

            </p>
            <p>
                Facebook began as a platform that took in-person relationships online, beginning with Harvard students
                and expanding to the world. People were curious and wanted to connect with others using Facebook, and
                that curiosity is part of what led to the great success of the service. Facebook uses social network
                analysis for advertising products to users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another software that connected people was Napster. Napster was a music downloading site, it harnessed
                computer to computer connections in a very straightforward way. If one user had an MP3 of a song that
                someone else wanted all they had to do was ask for it and download it straight to their hard drive.
                This put the music industry at a loss, as this was stealing and copyright infringement and the downfall
                of Napster led to the rise of the Apple Music and other digital music stores.

            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the online services that survive the rigors of the evolution of the eWorld replicate services
                that exist outside of the Internet. Namely, Craigslist, a service that replicates newspaper classifieds
                sections. Craigslist is about connecting people to what they need, whatever that may be. Additionally,
                Wikipedia, an online user-generated encyclopedia of everything, also exists to educate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both of these services do not set out to create profit, but to serve the users. Both of these services
                show that as users, we dictate what exists on the internet, that cyberspace belongs to consumers and
                not corporations, shifting away from an ad-driven internet and back towards the read-write web.
